Getting Started
-------------
To build this test app, we have decided to use Yeoman. Yeoman help us to create the boilerplate of any application
 using generators. In our case we have decided to use **angular-fullstack** that provides us with and *express + angular*
 app skeleton

Prerequisites: Node, Grunt, Yeoman, and Bower.  Once Node is installed, do:

    npm install -g grunt-cli yo bower

Next, install angular-fullstack generator:

    npm install -g generator-angular-fullstack

Also we will be using **bookshelf** ORM with **mysql** that requires knex installed globally

    npm install -g knex

Installing necessary dependencies
-----------------------

To install  **nodejs** modules necessary to run the app we go to the project folder and we run

    npm install
  
To install  **bower** modules necessary to run the app we go to the project folder and we run

    bower install
